# **Client management with react and hooks**

The idea of our company is to create a large application to manage clients. Therefore, client management, from the first session, has been developed using React due to its scalability.

Install dependencies: npm install
Run the app: npm run dev

Exercise 1.

The client management app is not working. The client list is not being updated when a new client is added. However, when the website is reloaded, all clients are displayed correctly. Do you know why?

The principal engineer tells you to fix the issue by creating a context for the entire app and saving the list of clients into this context. (Note that this change won't fix the issue, you could test your code using console.log).
